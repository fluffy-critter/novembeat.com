Don't.

### ... Care to elaborate?

Ethical and environmental concerns aside, this is an exercise in developing creative skills, not in producing something that sounds good devoid of any artistry.

Some AI tools are a productivity booster and are a net benefit (such as Logic's mastering assistant and session musicians) but those are *supplementing* human creativity, not replacing it. If your interest is in simply cranking out music without the ability to control the fundamental process of its creation and design, look elsewhere.

(And no, it is not "classist" or "ableist" to take this stance.)

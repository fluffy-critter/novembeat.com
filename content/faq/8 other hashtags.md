Feel free to use whatever hashtags you want, or none at all! It's all about having fun making music together, and the point to the hashtags is just to be found. As far as I know this is the only one with a website, but that's just so that I can collect and share the stuff people make. It's all good.

Do *note*, however, that `#notevember` is also used by people who are writing daily notes (as in the words/letters kind), so that causes some confusion.

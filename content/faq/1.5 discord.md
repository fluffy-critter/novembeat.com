There is a `#novembeat` channel on the [busybee Discord](https://beesbuzz.biz/discord), which is the closest there is to anything "official."

Otherwise there is no centralized community forum or discussion area, but several people do discuss using the `#novembeat` hashtag on social media, and discussions pop up on songwriting forums all over the Internet.

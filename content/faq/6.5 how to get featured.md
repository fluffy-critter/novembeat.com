Sure! If you'd like me to add something, get in touch and I'll see what I can do. Some means you can use (from most- to least-likely to succeed):

* Use [the entry submission page](/submit)
* Post a link to it as [an issue](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/novembeat.com/issues)
* [Email me](mailto:fluffy-novembeat%40b%65esbuzz.biz)
* Message me on [Mastodon](https://plush.city/@fluffy) or [Discord](/discord)
* Carrier pigeon

Include the following information:

* The name you'd like to be known as
* A link to your website, if any
* Link(s) to your music in the form of an embeddable playlist (e.g. YouTube, Funkwhale, Bandcamp album, etc.)

Please note that I maintain this website more or less by hand (there's no Algorithm or Discovery) so it might take a while for things to show up, and I'm not going to update it every time you post a new track (so, please use something that can update on its own after being embedded).

And of course, if you release an album with your Novembeat output, absolutely let me know!

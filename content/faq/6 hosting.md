Here are a few options for hosting your music in an embeddable playlist:

* Use [Bandcrash](https://fluffy.itch.io/bandcrash) to upload the album to [itch.io](https://itch.io/)
* Put an album on [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) (if you do this, mark it as a "preview" while you work on it so that you can do a proper release when you're done!)
* Find a [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio/) instance to join (or host one yourself, if you're able!)
* Convert your music into a video and add it to a playlist on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/)
* Self-host your files and provide player interface via [MusicFolderPlayer](https://github.com/ltGuillaume/MusicFolderPlayer) or [jPlayer](http://jplayer.org/) or the like (just as long as I can embed it with an `<iframe>`)

I am of course happy to hear about any other approaches!

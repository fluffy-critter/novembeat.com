Title: I'm totally new to music, can I participate?
Sort-Title: 350

Of course! There is no required skill level, and this is a great opportunity to learning how to do new things.

Here's some free or cheap software that you can use to get started:

* [LMMS](https://lmms.io/): A free, open-source music DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for Windows, Linux, and macOS
* Want to go oldschool? Check out a tracker like [Schism](http://schismtracker.org/) or [Furnace](https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace)
* You can also make music without installing anything using a web-based tracker like [Beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co/)
* A lot of musicians (including professionals!) use [Reaper](https://reaper.fm/), which is inexpensive, and comes with an *extremely* generous free trial period
* Every Mac and iPhone/iPad now comes with a free copy of [GarageBand](https://apple.com/garageband), so if you already have an Apple device you probably have that!

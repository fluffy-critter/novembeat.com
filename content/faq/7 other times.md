I mean, nobody's stopping you.

Here's some other regular music challenges to consider:

* [Song Fight!](https://songfight.org/), a weekly-ish songwriting challenge where you're given a title to write a song for (possibly the earliest and definitely the longest-running Internet songwriting challenge, since 2000!)
* In January there's [Jamuary](https://jonathanmann.net/jamuary), which in turn came from [Fun-A-Day](https://artclash.com/)
* February has [FAWM](https://fawm.org/), which also hosts the [Fifty-Ninety challenge](https://fiftyninety.fawm.org/) from July through October
* [Weekly Beats](https://weeklybeats.com/) is a year-long challenge to make one beat every week

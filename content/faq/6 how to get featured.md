Sure! If you'd like me to add something, get in touch and I'll see what I can do. Some means you can use (from most- to least-likely to succeed):

* Post a link to it as [an issue](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/novembeat.com/issues)
* [Email me](mailto:fluffy-novembeat%40b%65esbuzz.biz)
* Message me on [Mastodon](https://queer.party/@fluffy) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fluffy)
* Carrier pigeon

SoundCloud playlists are preferred, but anything that's easy to embed or link to is fine.

And of course, if you release an album with your Novembeat output, absolutely let me know!

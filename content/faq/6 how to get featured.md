Sure! If you'd like me to add something, get in touch and I'll see what I can do. Some means you can use (from most- to least-likely to succeed):

* Post a link to it as [an issue](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/novembeat.com/issues)
* [Email me](mailto:fluffy-novembeat%40b%65esbuzz.biz)
* Message me on [Mastodon](https://queer.party/@fluffy) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fluffy)
* Carrier pigeon

Embeddable playlists (e.g. SoundCloud, YouTube, Bandcamp, etc.) are preferred.

And of course, if you release an album with your Novembeat output, absolutely let me know!

Please note that I maintain this website more or less by hand (there's no Algorithm or Discovery) so it might take a while for things to show up, and I'm not going to update it every time you post a new track.

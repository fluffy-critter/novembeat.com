Owing a great debt to projects like [Inktober](https://inktober.com/) and [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/), Novembeat is an informal challenge to record one piece of music every day in November. It can be big or small, a mere notion or an entire symphony. Flex the creative muscle and try to learn something new.

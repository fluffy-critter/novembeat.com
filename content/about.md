Visual artists have [Inktober](https://inktober.com/), where the challenge is to complete one drawing, ideally on paper, every day in October.

Musicians have Novembeat, a similar challenge to record one piece of music every day in November.

This project was started in 2016 by [Paul Starr](https://pauls.adequate.website/); in his own words:

However, these are not the final rules that he settled on! Please see [the FAQ](/faq/) for more.
